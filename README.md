This repository contains my solutions to problems from the book **_"Classic Computer Science Problems in Java" by David Kopec_**. The book covers a wide range of foundational computer science topics, and I'm using it to improve my Java skills and explore algorithms and problem-solving techniques.

The solutions focus on writing clean, understandable, and maintainable code, adhering to industry best practices. Each problem is tackled with a strong emphasis on Object-Oriented Programming (OOP) principles, such as encapsulation, inheritance,polymorphism, and encapsulation ensuring modular and reusable designs.

Through this project, I aim to not only implement solutions but also gain a deeper understanding of the underlying concepts. Additionally, I strive to bring a creative mindset to problem-solving, finding innovative and efficient approaches to tackle complex challenges while keeping the codebase well-structured and easy to follow.

## Topics Covered

- **Recursion and Memoization**: Problems like the Fibonacci sequence, optimized with recursion and memoization.
- **Search Algorithms**: Binary search, depth-first search, and other classic techniques.
- **Dynamic Programming**: Solving problems like the knapsack problem and longest common subsequence.
- **Graph Algorithms**: Implementing shortest path algorithms like Dijkstra's.
- **Data Structures**: Leveraging arrays, linked lists, hash maps, and custom structures for efficient solutions.
- **Object-Oriented Programming (OOP)**: Using classes, inheritance, and encapsulation to design clean and reusable code.
